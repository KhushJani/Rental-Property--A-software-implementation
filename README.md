# Rental-Property--A-software-implementation

In this project, I developed a comprehensive software application to manage the rental units of a real estate company. The application was designed using a 3-layer architecture, consisting of a JavaFX user interface (Presentation Layer), business logic (Application Layer), and a simulated database (Data Layer) using mock objects.

The software follows the MVC architecture, separating the Model (business logic) from the View (user interface), and implementing a Controller to facilitate communication between the Model and the View.

The application manages various types of residential properties, including apartment buildings, condos, and houses, each with their unique attributes. It allows potential tenants to register their interest in specific units and notifies them via email when their desired unit becomes available.

I also implemented a centralized accounting system for the company's administration and tenants, tracking rent payments efficiently. The system handles lease contracts, containing tenant info, unit info, lease start and end dates, and rent amount.

The project required the use of appropriate design patterns, creation of proper inheritance hierarchies, and the use of polymorphism. I also implemented a minimum of 10 unit tests to ensure the robustness of the application.

In the second phase of the project, I enhanced the application by providing a GUI using JavaFX, ensuring that the functionality of displaying all properties runs on its own thread, separate from the GUI and business logic processes.

This project was a great opportunity to apply and enhance my software development skills, particularly in JavaFX, MVC architecture, and unit testing.
